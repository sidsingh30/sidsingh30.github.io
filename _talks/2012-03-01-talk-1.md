### Abstract
Effective public oversight of Autonomous Vehicle (AV) safety is currently limited by a critical
measurement gap. Despite high-level safety claims, the underlying reporting infrastructure across
agencies (CPUC, DMV, NHTSA) remains fragmented and inconsistent, preventing decision-grade
benchmarking across operational contexts.
This research introduces a comprehensive safety measurement methodology that bridges this gap by
integrating regulatory policy analysis with System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA). We establish
a traceable metric catalog that captures both regulatory blind spots and complex interaction-driven
hazards. These metrics are then operationalized through the harmonization of public datasets, enabling
the generation of exposure-normalized conditional probability tables (CPTs) and trend diagnostics.
The result is a dual-layer framework offering both a prioritized requirements list for future reporting
and an empirical evidence layer for immediate use. This methodology moves beyond simple aggregate
crash counts, providing stakeholders with the granular, context-aware benchmarking tools necessary
to distinguish true safety performance from reporting artifacts and drive evidence-based policy.
