### About

Autonomous vehicle operations are expanding quickly in California, and public agencies increasingly rely on safety reporting to govern permits, operating domains, and deployment conditions. However, current reporting across the California Public Utilities Commission, California DMV, and NHTSA’s Standing General Order is fragmented and inconsistent, which limits decision grade safety benchmarking across operators and operational contexts. This project addresses the gap between incident transparency and risk management by clarifying what today’s public data can actually support.

This project develops a safety centric measurement framework that translates reporting requirements and industry safety expectations into concrete, traceable metrics. The work delivers a structured gap analysis of CPUC, DMV, and NHTSA datasets and a standards aligned metric catalog that defines what should be reported to enable oversight.

The approach combines policy mapping with safety standards review to characterize both useful gaps, missing signals such as near miss and fallback performance, and usable gaps, such as unstable definitions and missing exposure denominators. Outputs support agencies and cities by enabling exposure normalized indicators, comparable trend diagnostics, and a minimum reporting package for future programs. Next steps extend this foundation through system theoretic modeling and empirical analysis to validate which metrics are most predictive of safety risk.
