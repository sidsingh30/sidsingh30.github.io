### About
Full Flight Simulators (FFS) are increasingly central to airline training capacity and safety assurance, especially for high utilization fleets like the Airbus A320neo. However, FFS deployments carry a common risk: small integration errors across facility interfaces, power, motion, visuals, and safety systems can cascade into schedule slips, recurring faults, or restricted motion envelopes. This project addresses the commissioning and handover gap between “delivered simulator hardware” and “training ready operations” for a CAE 7000XR A320neo installation.

This project documents and supports the end to end installation and commissioning of a CAE 7000XR A320neo simulator at a commercial training center. The work delivers a structured installation record combining facility readiness requirements, dated photo evidence, electrical verification measurements, subsystem integration milestones, incident documentation, and final operational checks.

The approach combines systems integration discipline with commissioning verification and safety compliance practices to characterize readiness across motion, visual stability, cooling, and detection systems (including VESDA, a very early smoke detection system). Outputs support installation closeout decisions by making constraints and risks explicit, including motion envelope interference, visual resonance behavior, and cooling warnings observed during final testing. Next steps typically include formal qualification and recurring reliability tracking to sustain dispatchability.
