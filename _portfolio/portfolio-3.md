### About

Autonomous vehicle (AV) operations are expanding in U.S. cities, and local jurisdictions are increasingly expected to make decisions about where AVs can operate, under what conditions, and with what oversight. However, public safety governance is constrained by fragmented reporting across agencies and inconsistent definitions of exposure, operating context, and incident severity. This limits decision grade benchmarking and makes it difficult to separate true safety performance from reporting artifacts.

This project develops a safety centric framework for integrating AVs into local jurisdictions using measurable, publicly defensible safety requirements. The work delivers a structured oversight package including a jurisdiction oriented safety metric catalog, recommended minimum reporting fields, and evidence products that translate public datasets into interpretable safety performance views. Together, these outputs enable agencies to evaluate readiness, monitor operations, and compare performance across operators and conditions.

The approach combines regulatory landscape synthesis with risk based measurement design and exposure normalized comparative analysis to characterize AV safety in operational context. Outputs support policy and operational decisions by linking safety indicators to conditions such as road type, lighting, weather, and operating mode, and by enabling repeatable trend diagnostics over time. Next steps include refining thresholds for deployment gating and aligning reporting requirements with implementable data collection practices across agencies and fleet operators.
