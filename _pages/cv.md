Education
======

* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), 2025

Work experience
======

### Researcher (Autonomous Vehicle Safety) — UCLA B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences (GIRS)
*Nov 2024 – Present*  
Supervisor: Dr. Ali Mosleh, Dr. Camila Correa-Jullian, Jean-Paul Velez (SFCTA)

- Built a safety measurement and benchmarking framework for SFCTA to compare AV performance using consistent definitions and exposure-normalized rates.
- Developed a tiered metric library (45+ implementable metrics) and mapped each metric to the specific data fields required to compute it using STPA-based safety logic.
- Combined CPUC operational reporting, CA DMV disengagements, and NHTSA SGO crash reports into a consistent analysis structure with shared context tags (weather, lighting, road type, surface, initiator).
- Produced dashboards, briefings, and reporting recommendations specifying what data should be reported so agencies can monitor trends and compare operators reliably.

### Systems Integration Engineering Intern (Airbus A320neo FFS) — CAE + Flight Simulation Training Centre (FSTC), Gurgaon, India
*Jul 2024 – Sep 2024*  
Supervisor: Jean-Michel (CAE), Kuldeep Adhana (FSTC)

- Supported systems integration and commissioning of the CAE 7000XR A320neo Full Flight Simulator, coordinating day-to-day execution across CAE specialists, the FSTC site team, contractors, and logistics.
- Integrated the simulator visual stack (Tropos 6000, projectors, BP screen) and supported alignment, calibration, and functionality checks during bring-up.
- Supported facility readiness and electrical integration work including power protection and grounding, transformer configuration changes, and resolving infrastructure issues that blocked commissioning (trenches, routing, climate-control/CVAC plumbing fixes).
- Performed troubleshooting and verification across motion and safety subsystems including actuator alignment corrections, VESDA smoke detection testing, and envelope testing to identify and escalate clearance constraints before acceptance.

### Production Engineering Intern — Complete Surveying Technology, Noida, India
*Jul 2023 – Sep 2023*  
Supervisor: Retd. Col Raj Suri

- Built and tested prototype parts for the 412D Digital Measuring Wheel including the spoke wheel and hand grip.
- Supported an electronics upgrade by integrating a custom circuit board and microcontroller to add capability while reducing the electronics footprint.
- Ran supervised injection-molding prototype trials on a Mitsubishi 350-ton machine to produce trial parts and check fit and assembly.
- Verified durability using simulation and physical testing, and documented key manufacturing steps across two plants so design choices matched real production constraints.

### Production Engineering Intern — AGM Jactex AG, Schaffhausen, Switzerland
*Jun 2022 – Sep 2022*  
Supervisor: Mark Feer

- Executed hot-press gluing experiments for Vulcan fiber sheet production and supported sheet preparation workflows from raw material through pressing.
- Optimized adhesive distribution for Vulcan fiber sheets using ABAQUS FEA and 5-axis CNC machining to improve manufacturing precision and consistency.
- Built a harness rewinding improvement to reduce spool changeover time and increase hourly production; supported dye-change preparation and manual bobbin changes on braiding machines.
- Established preventive maintenance schedules and supported repair work on harness braiding machines, reducing downtime by 20%.

### Student Billing Analyst — UCLA Library Financial Services, Los Angeles, CA
*May 2022 – Sep 2024*  
Supervisor: Ami Baxley

- Managed invoice payments and ensured Los Angeles County tax compliance in Alma; built a Python automation to identify and aggregate county invoices, improving processing efficiency and reducing manual rework.

### Student IT Consultant — UCLA Undergraduate Information Technology (UIT), Los Angeles, CA
*May 2022 – Dec 2022*  
Supervisor: Tommy Chiu, Peter Blase

- Provided front-line IT support across walk-up, phone, and ticketing workflows covering MyUCLA, Gradebook, Outlook, and account access issues; supported onboarding for new staff and created checklists to standardize recurring workflows and speed resolution.
