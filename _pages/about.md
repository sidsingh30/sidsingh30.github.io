I am a Researcher at the [B. John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences](https://www.risksciences.ucla.edu), developing a safety framework for autonomous vehicle deployment through a joint [Center of Excellence on New Mobility and Automated Vehicles](https://www.mobilitycoe.org) project in collaboration with the [San Francisco County Transportation Authority](https://www.sfcta.org).

I obtained my B.S. degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://www.mae.ucla.edu) at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) in June 2025. My current research focuses on safety measurement and benchmarking for autonomous vehicle deployment, applying probabilistic risk assessment and systems safety analysis methods to translate incident and operational reporting into measurable performance indicators that support consistent evaluation and stakeholder decision making.

Previously, I worked as a Systems Integration Engineer on the installation and commissioning of a [CAE 7000XR Airbus A320neo Full Flight Simulator (Level D)](https://www.fstc.in/our-fleet?tab=simulator) at [Flight Simulation Technique Centre](https://www.fstc.in). The role emphasized coordination across facility interfaces and simulator subsystems, and verification and closeout activities that support training readiness.
